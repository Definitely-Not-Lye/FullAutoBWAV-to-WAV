# TOTK Batch BWAV to WAV Converter

A simple little batch-operation python UI wrapper for [OpenRevolution](https://github.com/ic-scm/openrevolution/) by ic-scm [ONLY BWAV->WAV]. Made this because Foobar200+vgmstream doesn't always work

It's set to run in Open Revolution in Windows 8 compatibility mode, as suggested by ic-scm.

# Usage

Target the .bwav's folder, or choose individual files, hit convert, it'll run, and close itself and automatically open the output folder when it's done.
